# About this Minecraft Mod

I started working on this mod for a class where I was teaching some tweens how to code mods using Java. I wanted to make Minecraft a little more realistic and historical, so I started working on adding Bronze. One of the students made his mod have torches burn, so I added that and it snowballed from there.

This mod is for those who like to build and who like a bit more of a challenge. Torches and lanterns need upkeep, and you need to find both tin and copper for your early tools and armor.

Because this was intended for teaching use, some of the documentation is aimed towards beginner modders.

## Torches burn out

Both regular and copper torches will burn out. Regular torches last about a day, copper torches last three days.

Once they are burned out they become a Burnt Torch. When these are mined they drop only ashes (i.e. nothing). If they are mined before they burn out they don't drop themselves, but instead drop Kindling.

Kindling is only useful for burning in furnaces.

## Torches cause fire damage

If you cross through a torch's hitbox there is a decent chance you take a little fire damage. Mobs will also take the same damage. So be careful about where you place them!

If you hold a torch and hit a mob or animal with it, it will do some fire damage and can set it on fire. This applies to regular, copper, redstone, and soul torches.

Also, regular torches, but not copper torches, can set things they are placed on on fire. Be careful not to place them on things that can burn. Coal/Anthracite ore does burn.

## World generation of torches is updated

Torches that get placed on world generation (such as in villages) are changed to be either copper torches or lanterns. If they *can* be lanterns there is a good chance they will be - we try to place lanterns in the torches space and immediate neighbor blocks. Copper torches that are generated in this way can still burn out.

## Animals now drop Animal Fat

Animal Fat is a new item that some animals drop in addition to whatever they already do. This can be used as fuel in furnaces and lanterns.

A few of the ores are now renamed to be more accurate. For example, Raw Copper is now Malachite and Coal is Anthracite.

## Tin and Bronze

This mod adds Cassiterite Ore (AKA Tin), which can be smelted into Tin Ingots. Tin Ingots can be crafted into Tin Nuggets and Tin Blocks (and vice-versa).

It allows crafting Bronze Blocks, Bronze Ingots, Bronze Nuggets, Bronze Tools, Bronze Swords, and Bronze Armor. It disables the copper tools, swords, and armor since those were historically made with bronze and not copper.

Stone swords, pickaxe, and shovel are disabled since those don't make any sense. They just wouldn't be workable IRL.

We now have Bronze Lanterns (has one slot for fuel) and Bronze Hoppers (that have 3 spaces instead of 5 and are slower).

Lanterns now require fuel (Animal Fat or Oil) to light up. They need to be refilled, holding 16 units in a single slot. One unit of Animal Fat lasts a day, a bottle of Oil should last three days.

Added Zinc Ore (AKA Sphalerite), which smelts into Zinc Ingots (but only in a Blast Furnace or better).

Can now craft Zinc Blocks, Ingots, and Nuggets.

Can now craft Brass (8 Copper Ingots + 1 Zinc Ingot = 1 Brass Block). It can be crafted into Ingots and Nuggets, as usual.

Added a Copper Kettle, which can accept water, oil, and animal fat. If it holds animal fat and heat is applied (such as putting the kettle on a campfire) it will convert the animal fat to oil. We have also made composters drop a unit of oil every time it drops a bone meal. If a copper kettle or cauldron is below the composter it will catch the oil.

The copper kettle is just like a cauldron except it can't hold hot liquids and it's max capacity is 2 instead of 3.

Oil is the best "natural" fuel. It will produce more heat than coal.

Oil needs to be contained in a Glass Bottle or a bucket.

## Future

We intend to make Brass Tanks, Copper Pipes, and Brass Valves to store and deliver Oil.

Add the ability for copper kettles (and cauldrons?) to have copper pipes attached so they can provide fuel in an automated way.

Brass Lantern? It would have the ability to accept copper pipes for fueling.

Create a Sling and Tin Sling Bullets. (Probably belongs in a new separate mod.)

Add Aurochs. They are just like cows except they drop more meat, fat, and also drop wool. They only spawn at world generation, but can reproduce. If they are all killed off they go extinct.

Can we make waterwheels? Is there a way to use rotary power/crankshafts? Running pumps? Gearboxes? Axles? Redstone-powered brass pumps? Is it worth doing this? Can we make something that isn't a copy of Create, adding value while making it unique?
